%p.help
  You have enough passwords.
  You don't want to remember another, and I don't want to store it.
  Companies like
  Facebook, Google and Twitter
  allow other web sites like mine to use their authentication service.
  The Casa Danesa Project website has to trust them when they assert that you are you.
  They provide some other information like your name as you have identified yourself
  on their site.
  After you log into their web site, they will tell this site to trust
  that you are you. This makes life a lot easier for both of us.
